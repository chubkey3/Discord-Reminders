# Discord-Reminders
A simple bot that allows you to add and remove reminders that the bot will automatically notify you for on discord.

# How to Use
Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=991885124595626054&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add the bot to any server of your choice (recommended to create a new server with just you and the bot)

Once done, start a DM (direct message) with the bot but make sure to keep the bot in whatever server you added it to or else you cannot DM it.
